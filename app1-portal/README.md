## Portal Web App SSO using Java Servlets and JSP

### Prerequisites

In order to run this example you will need to have Java 8 and Maven installed. You can install Maven with [brew](http://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install maven
```

Check that your maven version is 3.0.x or above:
```sh
mvn -v
```

### Update configuration information

Enter your:

`client_id`, `client_secret`, `domain`, and `connection` information into `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`


Optionally, you can also choose whether to use the Auth0 Lock widget or a custom login page (portal and partner logins).

Just alter the boolean flag in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml` as follows:

```
<context-param>
   <param-name>auth0.custom_login</param-name>
   <param-value>false</param-value>
   <!--<param-value>true</param-value>-->
</context-param>
```

Setting as `false` will result in Lock widget being used. 


### Build and Run

In order to build and run the project you must execute:
```sh
mvn clean install tomcat7:run
```

Then, go to [http://localhost:3099/login](http://localhost:3099/login).

or

better still [http://app1.com:3099/login](http://app1.com:3099/login).


Sign in using the username / password you set up for the DB connection, and you're there!
